## Morris Traversal
Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion. The idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree. In this traversal, we first create links to Inorder successor and print the data using these links, and finally revert the changes to restore original tree. 

The Morris algorithm for inorder traversal allows you to traverse a tree with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity. But it requires changing the tree at runtime.
## Time Complexity:
We observe that every edge of the tree is traversed at most 3 times. The same number of extra edges, as in the input tree, is removed and created. Thus, the total time complexity of the above program is O(n).
## Space complexity 
O(1) 

## algorithm
Initialize a class Node which contains variables and pointers related to a node.
Create a function MorrisTraversal which accepts the root node.
If the root is null, return.
Set reference curr as root. Traverse while curr is not null.
If the left child of curr is null print value stored in curr and update curr as itâ€™s a right child.
Else update curr as a right node of the rightmost node of its left subtree and update curr as the left child of curr
