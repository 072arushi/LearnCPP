Cartesian Product of two Set

If A and B are two non-empty sets, then their Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pair of elements from A and B.

        A × B = {(x, y) : x ∈ A, y ∈ B}

Suppose, if A and B are two non-empty sets, then the Cartesian product of two sets, A and set B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a ∈A and b∈B which is denoted as A × B.

Example of cartesian product :
    set 1= {1,2,3}
    set 2 ={4,5}
    cartesian product = {{1,4},{1,5},{2,4}{2,5},{3,4},{3,5}}
