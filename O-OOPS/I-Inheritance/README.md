Inheritance in C++ an Overview
-->Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
-->In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
-->Reusing classes saves time and money
-->Reusing already tested and debugged classes will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again

What is Inheritance in C++?

-->The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance
-->We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting it
-->The existing class is called a base class
-->The new class which is inherited from the base class is called a derived class
-->Reusing classes saves time and money
-->There are different types of inheritance in C++

Forms of Inheritance in C++

-->Single Inheritance
-->Multiple Inheritance
-->Hierarchical Inheritance
-->Multilevel Inheritance
-->Hybrid Inheritance

Single Inheritance in C++

	Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class is inherited with only one base class.
