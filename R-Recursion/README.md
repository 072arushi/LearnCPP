# [Inversion Count](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/Day-100(Algorithms)/R-Recursion/Inversion_Count.cpp) 

Inversion Count for an array indicates – how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, 
but if the array is sorted in the reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. <br><br>
Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j <br>
## Example
```
Input: arr[] = {8, 4, 2, 1}
Output: 6

Explanation: Given array has six inversions:
(8, 4), (4, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1).


Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 2}
Output: 2

Explanation: Given array has two inversions:
(3, 1), (3, 2) 
```
# [Replace PI](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/Day-100(Algorithms)/R-Recursion/Replace_%CF%80.cpp)

Recursive program to replace all occurrences of pi with 3.14 in a given string
## Examples: 
```
Input : str = “pippppiiiipi” 
Output : 3.14ppp3.14iii3.14

Input : str = “pip” 
Output : 3.14p

Input : str = “xpix” 
Output : x3.14x
```

# [Tower of Hanoi](R-Recursion/TowerofHanoi.cpp)

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, <br>
which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, <br>
the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape.
## Examples: 
```
Input : 2
Output : Disk 1 moved from A to B
         Disk 2 moved from A to C
         Disk 1 moved from B to C

Input : 3
Output : Disk 1 moved from A to C
         Disk 2 moved from A to B
         Disk 1 moved from C to B
         Disk 3 moved from A to C
         Disk 1 moved from B to A
         Disk 2 moved from B to C
         Disk 1 moved from A to C
```
