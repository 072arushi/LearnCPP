# Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting basically refers to rearranging a collection of data into ascending or descending order.
- It is helpful when we have to perform searching faster, or to identify similar items.
- Some algorithms make use of sorting as a key subroutine.

### Terms explained :

- In place: If only constant memory is required other than the input array.
- Stable : If the order of identical elements in the array is retained.
- Make sure to understand the difference between increasing and non-decreasing order.



## Bubble Sort

- It repeatedly loops through the array elements to be sorted and compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are not in order.
-  A point to note : After every n^th iteration, the n^th largest element reaches at its right place (if sorting in ascending order)
-  We can find if an array is sorted or not using bubble sort in one iteration itself.

### Algorithm

```

begin BubbleSort(array)
    for all items in array
        if array[i]>array[i+1]
            swap(array[i],array[i+1])
        end if
    end for

    return array

end BubbleSort

```

### Properties

- Time Complexity : O(n^2)
- Auxillary Space : O(1)
- In-place : Yes
- Stable : Yes

### Advantages

- Can be useful to sort nearly-sorted arrays.

### Disadvantage

- Too slow and impractical in most cases.

### Algorithm

```

countingSort(array, size)
  max <- find largest element in array
  initialize count array with all zeros
  for j <- 0 to size
    find the total count of each unique element and 
    store the count at jth index in count array
  for i <- 1 to max
    find the cumulative sum and store it in count array itself
  for j <- size down to 1
    restore the elements to array
    decrease count of each element restored by 1

```

### Properties

- Time Complexity :
  - Worst case time	: O(n)
  - Best case time : O(n)
  - Average case time : O(n)
- Auxillary Space : O(n)
- In-place : No
- Stable : Yes

### Advantages

- Linear time sorting technique, making it faster than comparison based algorithms.

### Disadvantage

- Works for restricted inputs only for a certain range and takes extra space.
