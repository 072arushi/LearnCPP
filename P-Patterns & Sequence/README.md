## 1. [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/P-Patterns%20%26%20Sequence/FibonacciSequence.cpp)
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, <br>
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and <br>
 That is,
```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```
Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

#### Example :
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

## 2. [Pascal's Triangle](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/blob/main/P-Patterns%20%26%20Sequence/PascalsTriangle.cpp)
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

#### Example :
```
Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
```
