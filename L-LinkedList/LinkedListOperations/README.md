# Segregate Even Odd

The Problem Statement : Give a Linked List of integer, write a function to modify the linked list such that all even numbers appear before all the odd numbers in the modified linked list. Also, keep the order of even and odd numbers the same

### Task perform 
- Comparision Linkedlist elements
- Insertion a node in Linkedlist in Front
- Insertion a node in Linkedlist in End


### Explanation 
 - First Step is we take a length of LinkedList as input.
 - Second Step is to take input of the Head Node.
 - Pointing tail and head to the Head node.
 - Create a for loop in length -1 times because we alrady take the head.
 - We create a function who compair the input element passing with Head and tail  with the input data.
 -  Oddevenchecker funciton to check if the data is odd the call InsertAtTail function to Insert in End of the Head Node of the LinkedList. Or if the data is even the call InsertAtHead function to insert Node in Front Head of the LinkedList.
 - After all thing call function print to print LinkedList.
