### Circular Linked List
A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle.

There are basically two types of circular linked list:

1. Circular Singly Linked List

2. Circular Doubly Linked List

Here, in addition to the last node storing the address of the first node, the first node will also store the address of the last node.

## Circular Linked List Complexity	(Time Complexity	Space Complexity)
Insertion Operation	O(1) or O(n)	
Deletion Operation	O(1)

## Why Circular Linked List?

1) The NULL assignment is not required because a node always points to another node.
2) The starting point can be set to any node.
3) Traversal from the first node to the last node is quick.

## Applications Of Circular Linked List
1 ) It is used in multiplayer games to give a chance to each player to play the game.
2 ) Multiple running applications can be placed in a circular linked list on an operating system. The os keeps on iterating over these applications.
